In this project I built an interactive dashboard in Excel from a coffee orders dataset, by:

•	Collecting data from worksheets using logical and lookup functions (IF, XLOOKUP, INDEX and MATCH) and formatting the data as a table for multiple purposes, 

•	Inserting pivot tables and charts on different worksheets,

•	Sumarizing data to find out the number of sales by date, country, and top 5 customers, and

•	Pasting the charts into a new Dashboard worksheet using slicers and timelines.
